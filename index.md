I know English, മലയാളം (Malayalam), हिंदी  (Hindi),	and a smattering of 日本語 (Japanese) and मराठी  (Marathi).

I graduated in Mechanical Engineering from IIT Guwahati, back in 2012. But early
on, I realized that I preferred the world of computers. I took to CS courses like
a duck to water, and adopted Linux as main OS in my second year. I was the geek
that classmates turned to for tech support. :nerd_face:

So I decided to switch fields, going for a Master of Technology in Computer
Science in IIT Bombay. During the course, I worked for the department as an RA
in System Administration, and got plenty of opportunity to hone my Linux skills.
:smile:

Then, at Yahoo! Japan, I did DevOps for the NoSQL team, principally working on
Cassandra.

I am a profilic contributor to [Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com/users/1042873/muru?tab=top),
mostly on the Ask Ubuntu and Unix &amp; Linux sites. I have also contributed to
the creation of the Vi and Vim SE site, serving as one of its first pro-tem moderators.

I share the hobby of the masses - reading. :stuck_out_tongue:  Favourite books
include:

- *The Green Mile*,
- Robert Jordan's *The Wheel of Time* series,
- Asimov's *Foundation* series,
- Clarke's *Rama* series,
- Stephenson's *Anathem*,
- Sanderson's *Stormlight Archive*

I took up photography in IIT Bombay and cycling after I moved to Japan.
Photography is my driving passion when it comes to the outdoors: when I travel
for fun, I travel to photograph. That's why I like cycling - it affords more 
opportunities to capture visuals than racing past in a bike or a car does.
Sadly, I haven't really kitted up: I have a Nikon D5300 and a 2016 Giant Contend 2.

I am a Gooner. Favourite players include "Mad Jens" Lehmann, Dennis Bergkamp
and Wojciech Szczęsny.  I have been an Arsenal fan since the Champions League
final in Paris, 2006. (Yes, that's after Bergkamp's time.)
