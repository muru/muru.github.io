	<h4 style="text-decoration: underline; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Pet peeves include:</h4>
	<ol style="margin-top: 0;">
		<li>Menus in web pages that don't work in mobile phones,
			especially one with touchscreens. See the CSE site for an
			example.</li>
		<li>Webpages laid out using tables. This one most
			definitely isn't.</li>
		<li>Sites (really, most about anything) with mostly white backgrounds.</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="section">
	<p> As you may have noticed from the site, I prefer dark
	backgrounds, with not-too-light text.
	<p> I would have chosen the green-on-black style seen on 
	terminals, but most of you would have fled from the 
	monitor screaming, <em>"My eyes! MY EYES!"</em>, wouldn't you?
	<p> Don't believe me?
