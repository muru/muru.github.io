Call me Muru.

<!-- section -->

I am an aspiring BOFH. Often called a psycho. Now in my third year of the Master
of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering course in IIT Bombay, and
working for the department as an RA in System Administration, I get plenty of
opportunity to hone my skills. :)

I share the hobby of the masses - reading. :stuck_out_tongue:  Favourite books include *The
Green Mile*, *The Wheel of Time* series, the *Foundation* series and the *Rama*
series.

I am a Gooner. Favourite players include "Mad Jens" Lehmann, Dennis Bergkamp
and Wojciech SzczÄ™sny.  I have been an Arsenal fan since the Champions League
final in Paris, 2006.
