title: Yet another Jekyll post
layout: post
tags: [jekyll, config]
---

I shifted my personal site to Jekyll some time ago, but I hadn't yet fully
embraced it. Now that I'd decided to blog again, I set about using Jekyll to see
if it could provide support for the blogger Hyde in me. (Yes, yes, that was
terrible.)

I needed to set it up so that the site would work across the three ways it can
be accessed:

- [Github Pages](https://murukeshm.github.io)
- [Personal domain](https://murukesh.me)
- [CSE homepage](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~murukesh)

Github Pages, while decidedly convenient for starting out, is not so convenient
when it comes to expanding. Not that Jekyll is all that convenient either.

1. You cannot easily publish your blog posts under a subdirectory
2. Posts cannot have a counter-based ID. The permalink can only be based on the
   date and title.
3. You have to rely on external providers for comment support. Maybe Disqus, or
   Facebook, or something else.

But...

1. Markdown is fun to write in. It is clear, logical and the source is easy to
   read.
2. Jekyll seems to do a good job of templating, without too much boilerplate.
3. Having things like code highlighting taken care of is quite convenient.

Setting up Jekyll is quite easy - the site has good instructions. I'll just
focus on things I had trouble doing.

# Page permalinks

On Github, pages could be accessed both with and without an extension (`/index`
and `/index.html` both worked fine). Naturally, I stuck to the extension-less
form. Running Jekyll locally, I ran into trouble - it did not support
extension-less access. I'd guess this is presumably because the Github Pages
setup has something like this (in terms of `nginx` config):

    try_files $uri $uri.html ...;

Annoyed, I resorted to specifying the permalinks manually. After all, I did only
have four pages - the rest generated as posts. And `index.md` didn't need any
help, so the mess is down to three pages.

# Code Highlighting

Displaying code proved to be a tricky thing. I'm software guy, naturally my post
will include bits of code here and there. I want it to be pretty (syntax
highlighting, line numbers, the works). Jekyll offers two ways for prettifying
code: [Pygments] and [Rouge]. Pygments is written in Python, and Rouge in Ruby.
So, naturally, you might think Rouge is the way to go, since the whole damned
thing will be in Ruby. Nope.

The thing is, sticking to what Github Pages offers really does constrain you.
And Pages doesn't support Rouge. So, Pygments is the way to go, and is the
default.

The first time I tried it out, the result was some consternation. You see, back
when I first made this site for the CS699 course, I'd set `display: block` for
`span` tags. And Pygments relies heavily on `span` tags with CSS classes for
Highlighting. So, where I'd hoped to see something like:

![vim-code-proper]({{site.base-url}}/images/jekyll/proper.png)

I got (without the colours):

![vim-span-block]({{site.base-url}}/images/jekyll/span.png)

Flabbergasted, I decided to try out Rouge, and it seemed to work fine, except I
had barely any highlighting - the output was marked up, but I didn't have
corresponding CSS. The docs suggested picking up a sample `syntax.css` which is
purportedly close to Github's own style. Ah... But I wanted a dark theme, and I
wasn't too fond of Github's theme as it is. After a bit of going around in
circles, I realised Rouge wasn't supported by Github, and so I went back to
Pygments. A quick inspection showed me what the problem was, and just as quickly
I deleted the offending CSS rule. I had no idea why it was around, since I used
barely any `span` blocks - at least, I couldn't see any visible effect on the
site! With that problem solved, two remained: the colour theme conundrum, and
line numbers.

<aside markdown="1">
I could have gone the JavaScript way, but I wanted to see how much I could
accomplish server-side. I'd looked at a couple of code highlighting JavaScript
libraries back in the day, and I vaguely recall deciding them to be not worth
the effort. Plus, Pygments and Rouge both supported VimScript (or VimL, as you
may prefer to call it), whereas whatever library Stack Exchange used didn't
(it's [Google Code Prettify](https://github.com/google/code-prettify)).
</aside>

Like with Rouge, the next problem was CSS. Thankfully, the step to get a CSS
file for Pygments was easy:

    pygmentize -S <theme> -f html > foo.css

After a few trials, I chose the `normal` theme.

Line numbering was harder. Oh, both could do numbering, but the numbers would be
selected too when you selected the code, and worse, copied. Apparently, Pygments
supported a `table` option to `linenos`, but it looked weird. There was [a
delightful solution](proper-line-numbers) that involved using `lineanchors`
instead of `linenos`, and then applying a CSS counter to create the numbers.
Unfortunately, `lineanchors` doesn't work when Jekyll runs in `safe` mode, which
it does on Github. Then I applied the same technique to `linenos`, and hid the
numbers generated by Pygments :mask::

{% highlight css linenos %}
pre {
    counter-reset: line-numbering;
}

pre span.lineno::after {
	content: counter(line-numbering, decimal-leading-zero);
	counter-increment: line-numbering;
	opacity: 0.4;
	-webkit-touch-callout: none;
	-webkit-user-select: none;
	-khtml-user-select: none;
	-moz-user-select: none;
	-ms-user-select: none;
	user-select: none;
	visibility: visible;
	margin-left: -1em;
}

pre span.lineno {
	visibility: collapse;
	text-align: right;
	display: inline-block;
	min-width: 1em;
}
{% endhighlight %}

# Sectioning

By default, the entire post content is stuffed into the `content` Liquid
variable. If you want to split your post into sections, tough luck. This
[StackOverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/q/26395044/2072269) helped me out.
One of the answers talks about the `post.excerpt` feature, where you can use an
`excerpt_separator` to demarcate out the post blurb, in case you want something
different from the default. Turns out, the idea can be easily extended to a
generic separator. For example, add to your `_content.yaml`:

```yaml
section_separator: "<!-- section -->"
```

And create a new layout (say `_layouts/sectioned_posts.html`) containing (aside
from the boilerplate):

{% highlight liquid linenos %}
{% raw %}
{% assign sections = content | split: site.section_separator %}
{% for section in sections %}
<section>
{{ section }}
</section>
{% endfor %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Your source will look like:

{% highlight html linenos %}

I share the hobby of the masses - reading. :P

# Comments

The last thorny issue was comments. I wanted to enable comments, even if the
site had tumbleweeds rolling around. Given the static nature of the site,
storing comments here was out of the question. That left me with external
providers.

I tried [Google+ comments], but text area never loaded
properly. Using [Github issues] seems to be a nice idea, but I'm too lazy to
follow through on it. I tried [Facebook comments] but an odd issue
popped up: when I clicked on the text box on my phone, the orientation was
forced to landscape, even though the device hadn't rotated. So, I ditched it and
went to [Disqus]. After styling it nicely, I opened my phone to test â€¦ and ran
into the same problem. Soon after posting on the Disqus forums, I found the
problem: [Android silliness]. The soft keyboard eats in to the page display area,
thus changing the height and hence the orientation.

I wanted to consider both the height and width, so the accepted answer (using
`max-width`) was not acceptable to me. The next-best solution used boundary
values for `aspect-ratio` different from `1/1`. After some more digging around,
I decided to use [`device-aspect-ratio` instead][my-answer].
