title: Back to Dihing!
---

So, finally I'm, back in Dihing, my second home... It does feel great to be
back. I wonder what New year celebrations would be like with so few students
here. Aside from the return to home2 part, most of it has been quite annoying. I
landed in Guwahati at 1:30 in the morning on the 30th (that's 12 hours late,
half a day wasted!), waited five and a half hours for the bus, lugged my luggage
to the hostel, where I find the mess and canteen closed, the tubelight in my
room not working, and no balance in my phone, and the validity period over too.
Then I went to Barak to breakfast, and lo!, its aloo paratha, and I hate
parathas.

Now I'm running around, filling the no dues form, finding out grades for
friends, and that reminds me of the part that sucks most, my grade. Being a
seven pointer is OK, but still it is disheartening.

If there's a silver lining, its got to be my laptop, which is a quite tarnished
silver lining. I hate Windows Update, which takes an hour just to figure out the
size of the updates. But, finally, I'm able to play Hitman: Blood Money on my
laptop.

Meeting friends once again is my greatest pleasure, I walk around on the campus,
see familiar faces, meet an occasional buddy... this does give me a sense of
well-being. I hope my friends will return soon. Its a long wait. Till then,
Hitman and the Saw series will keep me from boredom. BYE!
